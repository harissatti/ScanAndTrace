# ScanAndTrace
Scan and Trace
The Scan and Trace smart contract is an Ethereum-based contract that implements the ERC1155 token standard. It enables the creation and management of fungible tokens with unique token IDs and associated metadata.we use this for scan and trace
the product. the smart contract give unique id to each product and smae id is use for QRcode .when ever user came and scan the product qr code the code tell about the product details.


Features
The contract includes the following features:

Token Minting: The contract owner can mint a specified amount of tokens with a unique token URI.
Token URI: Each token has an associated URI that provides metadata and additional information about the token.
Token Transfer: Users can transfer tokens to other addresses, including multiple tokens in a single transaction.
Token Balance: Users can check their token balance and retrieve the list of token IDs they own.
Pausing: The contract owner can pause and unpause token transfers to control token functionality during critical events or emergencies.
Usage
To use the Scan and Trace contract, follow these steps:

Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network of your choice.
Set the desired token URI base by invoking the constructor of the contract. The base URI should point to the location where the token metadata is stored.
As the contract owner, you can mint tokens by calling the mint function and specifying the amount and token URI. Each token minted will have a unique token ID.
Users can transfer tokens to other addresses by calling the safeTransferFrom or safeBatchTransferFrom functions. Ensure that the user has sufficient balance and approval for the token transfer.
Users can check their token balance and retrieve the list of token IDs they own by calling the balanceOf and getUserIds functions, respectively.
The contract owner has the ability to pause and unpause token transfers by calling the pause and unpause functions, respectively.
Requirements
The Scan and Trace contract relies on the following external dependencies:

OpenZeppelin's ERC1155 contract: @openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol
OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract: @openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol
